learning git hub and zen hub


The video focused a lot on the command line.  I found I can make files directly on github, but somethings I couldn't understand like how to make a directory folder.  For that I used the commands shown in the video.  First I cloned the main assignment with git clone, i navigated to where I cloned it using cd, then I added some folders and changed some things.  When I was ready, I used git add ., git commit -m "uploading files".
